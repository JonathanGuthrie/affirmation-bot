This is a robot that uses the Jabber protocol to IM affirmations to subscribers every day.  It uses the gloox C++ Jabber library.

If you Jabber for IM (using, for example, Google Talk) and want to get an affirmation every day, add i.remind.you.three.times@gmail.com to your contacts and send it a message of "subscribe".
