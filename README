This is a robot that uses the Jabber protocol to IM affirmations to subscribers
every day.  It uses the C++ Jabber library that I have written.

If you Jabber for IM (using, for example, Google Talk) and want to get an affirmation every day, add affirmations@jabber.brokersys.com to your contacts and send it a message of "subscribe".
